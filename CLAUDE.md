## Feature Implementation Details

### üéØ Intelligent Spaced Repetition System

**Location**: `src/spacedRepetition.ts`, `src/hooks/useSpacedRepetition.ts`

**How it works**:
- **No time-based scheduling** - practice when you want, not when forced
- **Adaptive difficulty weighting** - words with lower `easeFactor` (harder for you) appear more frequently
- **Quality-based learning** - performance affects word difficulty and future appearance rate
- **Progress tracking** - tracks repetitions and strength (easeFactor) per word per language pair

**Key Functions**:
- `updateWordProgress()` - Updates word difficulty based on your performance (0-5 quality scale)
- `calculateWordStrength()` - Converts easeFactor (1.3-2.5+) to user-friendly strength percentage (0-100%)
- `getRandomWord()` with weighted selection - Harder words get higher probability of selection

### üìä Visual Progress System

**Location**: `src/components/ProgressDisplay.tsx`, word display in `src/LangApp.tsx`

**Features**:
1. **Individual Word Indicators**:
   - Color-coded strength badges (Red <30%, Yellow 30-69%, Green 70%+)
   - Repetition count tracking
   - Mini progress bars with gradient colors
   
2. **Category Statistics**:
   - Overall stats: Total, Mastered (3+ reps), Learning (1-2 reps), New (0 reps)
   - Category-specific breakdowns when category selected
   - Average strength calculation per category

3. **Dynamic UI Updates**:
   - Progress display title changes: "Greetings Progress" vs "Your Progress"
   - Grid layout adjusts (4 or 5 columns) based on whether category avg strength is shown

### üîÑ Practice Modes

**Location**: `src/LangApp.tsx` (modes), `src/hooks/useAppState.ts` (state)

1. **Learn Mode**: 
   - Shows word and translation simultaneously
   - Quality score: 3 (neutral learning)
   - Use: Initial exposure to new words

2. **Answer Mode**: 
   - Type the translation
   - Quality score: 4 (correct) or 1 (incorrect)
   - Use: Active recall practice

3. **Guess Mode**: 
   - Multiple choice (4 options)
   - Quality score: 4 (correct) or 1 (incorrect)
   - Use: Recognition practice

### üåç Multi-Language Architecture

**Location**: Language handling throughout `src/LangApp.tsx`

**Supported Languages**: English, Italian, Japanese, Czech, Portuguese, Spanish

**Features**:
- **Bidirectional practice** - learn any direction (e.g., English‚ÜíItalian or Italian‚ÜíEnglish)
- **Speech synthesis** with language-specific voice selection
- **Separate progress tracking** per language pair and content type
- **LocalStorage keys**: `sr_progress_{contentType}_{fromLanguage}_{toLanguage}`

### üíæ Data Storage & State Management

**Location**: `src/hooks/useLocalStorage.ts`, `src/hooks/useSpacedRepetition.ts`

**Storage Strategy**:
- **LocalStorage** for all persistence (no server required)
- **Separate progress per language pair** - English‚ÜíItalian progress independent of Italian‚ÜíEnglish
- **Category-aware storage** - progress includes category information for filtering
- **JSON serialization** of WordProgress objects with easeFactor, repetitions, etc.

**Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface WordProgress {
  wordId: string;           // "hello_greetings" 
  category: string;         // "greetings"
  fromLanguage: string;     // "english"
  toLanguage: string;       // "italian"
  easeFactor: number;       // 1.3-2.5+ (difficulty)
  repetitions: number;      // 0, 1, 2, 3+ (mastery level)
}
```

### üóÇÔ∏è Content Organization

**Location**: `src/data/vocabulary/`, `src/data/phrases/`

**Structure**:
- **Modular category files** - each category in separate TypeScript file
- **Consistent schema** - all words have same structure across languages
- **Barrel exports** - main `vocabulary.ts` and `phrases.ts` re-export everything
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript coverage with `VocabularyWord` and `Phrase` types

**Categories**:
- **19 vocabulary categories** (greetings, numbers, food, verbs, etc.)
- **11 phrase categories** (basic, restaurant, travel, emergency, etc.)
- **Easy to extend** - just add new category file and update main export

### Development Notes

- The app uses Preact (lightweight React alternative) with hooks
- **Uses Preact's native `class` prop instead of React's `className`** - all components use `class` for CSS classes
- **Always use arrow functions in JSX event handlers** - use `onClick={() => handleClick()}` instead of `onClick={handleClick}`
- Styling combines Tailwind CSS v4 utilities with custom CSS in `src/index.css`
- No test framework configured yet
- Prettier configured for code formatting
- State management combines local component state with localStorage persistence via custom hooks
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Components follow a modular structure with barrel exports from `components/index.ts`

## User Experience Flow

### How the App Adapts to Learning

1. **First Time**: New words appear randomly, building initial familiarity
2. **After Practice**: Algorithm learns your strengths/weaknesses per word
3. **Ongoing Use**: Harder words (low easeFactor) appear more frequently automatically
4. **Progress Visualization**: Color-coded feedback shows improvement over time

### Typical User Journey

1. **Setup**: Choose languages (e.g., English ‚Üí Italian), select content type (vocabulary/phrases)
2. **Category Selection**: Pick topic area (greetings, food, etc.) or practice all
3. **Practice Mode**: Choose learning style (learn/answer/guess)
4. **Adaptive Practice**: App intelligently selects words based on your performance
5. **Progress Tracking**: View stats overall or per category to identify areas to focus

### Smart Features in Action

- **Weighted Selection**: If you struggle with "ciao" (easeFactor drops to 1.5), it appears ~2x more than "grazie" (easeFactor 2.3)
- **Visual Feedback**: Struggling words show red strength indicators, improving words turn yellow then green
- **Category Insights**: See you're 85% strong in greetings but only 45% in verbs - practice accordingly
- **No Pressure**: Practice when you want, no "due cards" or rigid schedules

### Technical Architecture Summary

This is a **client-side only** application (no backend needed) that uses:
- **Preact** for lightweight, React-like UI components
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with custom design system
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds
- **LocalStorage** for persistent progress without requiring accounts or servers

The architecture prioritizes **simplicity**, **performance**, and **user agency** - you control your learning pace while the app intelligently adapts to help you improve efficiently.
